            <h2>I play Guitar</h2>
            <p>I play the guitar to sing the songs that I want. I started playing guitar when I decided to use the guitar they bought for me when I was elementary on my first year of college. My friend, Emman taught me how to play it and now I can play a bunch of songs. I really love the songs of Ed Sheeran. I only play the songs that has meaning to me.</p>

            <h2>I like Dancing</h2>
            <p>Believe it or not I was a dancer. I'm good at dancing maybe decent enough to be in a troupe. I was inspired by the troupe of Jabbawockeez. My friends and I tried and succesfully imitated them. We perform during events in our hometown just for the fun of it. To be honest I had a phobia in executing acrobatic style of dancing but I can manipulate my body to execute a freestyle of motions and transitions like most modern dancers do.</p>

            <h2>I play the Rubik's Cube</h2>
            <p>The reason why I know how to solve the Rubik's cube is because I have nothing to do on my vacation during my elementary days at Grade 5. A YouTube video taught me how to solve it using a series algorithms. It took me a week to finally solve it on my own. I only play this toy whenever my dad or cousin uses my computer to browse and play so I won't be bored waiting for my turn.</p>

            <h2>I play League of Legends</h2>
            <p>I play League of Legends during my vacant hours with my friends if there is no requirements or assignments to do. My IGN is Hyperion Tension. I'm always trying to be better at the game. I'm always mad at toxic players because I WAS one of them. I am currently unranked this Season 7. My last placement was Diamond V.</p>
