        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>My name is Rey Meljohn Sison Guieb. I was born on November 22, 1997 at Villaflor, Dagupan City. I live in Aguilar, Pangasinan. My mother's name is Janine S. Guieb and my father's name is Melrey B. Guieb. I have no siblings. I am the only child. It's quite boring. Although I have my friends and cousins. In my elementary days, I went to Aguilar Holy Infant Educational Center Inc. or AHIECI. I graduated there as a Salutatorian and got a bunch of awards. In my vacation after my graduation, I learned how to solve the Rubik's Cube following the tutorial of a Youtuber.</p>
		<p>In High School, I went to Saint Columban's College, Lingayen, Pangasinan. Being a high school student is fun and full of life but in my first years it was hard to adjust on waking up early. I was scolded for being always late at my school. I've used too many one whole pad papers for my excuse letters. But after I got used to wake up early I was never late again. My friends and I during our break time we always have the time to read books and sometimes gossip around the campus. In our group of friends, I am the only one who is not sporty which is lame when I go out with them and play sports.</p>
		<p>I am now a student of Saint Louis University studying BSIT. I have met a lot of good people here. My friends Karl, Emman, Kenneth, Jacob, Austine, Dean, Rommel and Earvin. Sometimes we study and play together. But sometimes I feel more comfortable when I’m alone. I always wanted to learn more but I kept sleeping more. I am not creative enough to design things, I need an idea to accomplished things, I’m not quite adept at learning in my own when it comes to the quality of work. I need an example to follow and then I could use that as a tool to create more.</p>
